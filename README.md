# Description:
Tracks AutoGPT Conversations and Categorizes them for easy access
- mainly used by anonhostpi to track common issues with AutoGPT

A lot of issues/prs/discussions end up getting recreated, because contributors struggle to find previous issues

Since I am a _junkie_ for issue tracking, I have created this public gist to help others navigate AutoGPT's repo.

    - my discord name: anonhostpi 

## Don't Like How Developer/Community Convos are Presented Here?

You can find this tracker **both as a gist and as a repo**:
- Gist: https://gist.github.com/anonhostpi/97d4bb3e9535c92b8173fae704b76264
- Repo: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Catalysts

Github Gists presents files linearly, while the repo presents them in a folder structure.

Gists are easier to read, but repos are easier to contribute to

## Interesting and Fun Tools:

[Microsoft's GPT2 Neuron Viewer][neuron-viewer] - a tool to visualize the neurons of GPT2
- Explained here: https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models
