It is important to note that [chat.openai.com][chat] and [platform.openai.com][platform] are not the same tools. Billing for one is completely different from the other.

Whenever making changes to [https://platform.openai.com][platform], you'll need to verify that the key didn't change or to regenerate one if needed.
