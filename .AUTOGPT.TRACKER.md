Description: Tracks AutoGPT Conversations and Categorizes them for easy access
- mainly used by anonhostpi to track common issues with AutoGPT

A lot of issues/prs/discussions end up getting recreated, because contributors struggle to find previous issues

Since I am a _junkie_ for issue tracking, I have created this public gist to help others navigate AutoGPT's repo.
